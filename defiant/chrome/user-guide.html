			<h2>Trust Levels</h2>
			<article>
				<p>
					The Defiant Browser Extension works on the concept of trust levels.
					By default, no website is trusted. You (as the user) are in charge
					of which website is to be trusted.
				</p>
				<h3>Trust Level: Zero</h3>
				<p>
					This trust level is best for Static Websites. It is the defaulted
					trust level. No persistent tracking data of any kind can be set by
					the Website.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enable Media from first-party or second-party domains.</li>
					<li>Enable Stylesheets from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Trust Level: Alpha</h3>
				<p>
					This trust level is best for Interactive Websites. It allows dynamic
					content while trying to preserve your privacy as good as possible.
					Persistent tracking data is limited to the current Browsing Session,
					and the lifetime of Cookies is modified so that they are cleared
					automatically when the Browser is closed.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enable Media from first-party or second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Stylesheets from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable JavaScript from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Cookies from first-party or second-party domains.</li>
					<li>Limit Cookies to the current browsing session.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Trust Level: Beta</h3>
				<p>
					This trust level is best for Web Apps that require third-party
					Authentication Services or Login Providers. Persistent data is
					permanently stored and won't be cleared by the Defiant Browser
					Extension.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enable Media from first-party or second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Stylesheets from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable JavaScript from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Cookies from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Link Prefetching from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Location Redirects from first-party and second-party domains or known <abbr title="Content Distributor Networks">CDNs</abbr>.</li>
					<li>Enable Frames from first-party and second-party domains.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Trust Level: Gamma</h3>
				<p>
					This trust level is best for Social Media Apps that require a
					lot of tracking mechanisms that do cross-domain communication.
					Persistent data is permanently stored and won't be cleared by
					the Defiant Browser Extension.
					<br>
					Use this Trust Level only when you are absolutely sure about
					the consequences of sharing your identity and fingerprint.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enable Media from all domains.</li>
					<li>Enable Stylesheets from all domains.</li>
					<li>Enable JavaScript from all domains.</li>
					<li>Enable Cookies from all domains.</li>
					<li>Enable Link Prefetching all domains.</li>
					<li>Enable Location Redirects from all domains.</li>
					<li>Enable Frames from all domains.</li>
				</ul>
